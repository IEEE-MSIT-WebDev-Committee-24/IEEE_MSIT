      <p className="container-title">OPPORTUNITIES</p>
      <p className="cont">IEEE is a large organization. Many opportunities for students exist that are not directly sponsored by Student Activities. To ensure that the brightest and most capable young minds have the resources they need to pursue a technologically-oriented education, we have collected information about grants, scholarships, and other opportunities for students for you to search here.</p>

      <p className="container-title">CONTESTS FOR STUDENTS</p>
      <p className="cont">The IEEE offers many opportunities for students to win contests for outstanding performance in a variety of areas. Students, here you will be able to search for opportunities to receive recognition and prizes for your innovative thinking and hard work. Sponsors, here you can have the opportunity to recognize some of the best and brightest young engineering minds while taking the opportunity to reinforce your organization’s dedication to the support of the next generation of IEEE leaders.</p>

      <p className="container-title">SAC AWARDS PROGRAMS</p>
      <p className="cont">Student branches are crucial to the growth and development of IEEE Student members. Student branches create a local network of students and give students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field. Student branches offer numerous educational, technical, and professional advantages to IEEE Student members through special projects, activities, meetings, tours, and field trips. However, these activities and advantages aren’t done without the effort, labor, and diligence of volunteers. IEEE has created several Student Branch Awards to recognize and reward the efforts of these tireless individuals and teams.</p>
