                        Student branches are crucial to the growth and development of IEEE Student members. Student branches create a local network of students and give students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field. 
                        Student branches offer numerous educational, technical, and professional advantages to IEEE Student members through special projects, activities, meetings, tours, and field trips.
                        However, these activities and advantages aren’t done without the effort, labor, and diligence of volunteers. IEEE has created several Student Branch Awards to recognize and reward the efforts of these tireless individuals and teams.
