IEEE is the worldâ€™s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities.<br></br> 
IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation.
IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The organization is chartered under this name and it is the full legal name.
